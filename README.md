# Outer Reach TypeScript + Nodemon + Material UI

Implemented [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.com) on both the server and the client while using [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to live reload the server code without affecting the Next.js universal code.

Server entry point is `server/index.ts` in development and `dist/index.js` in production.
The second directory should be added to `.gitignore`.

## Setup Outer Reach App From the code source

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```
